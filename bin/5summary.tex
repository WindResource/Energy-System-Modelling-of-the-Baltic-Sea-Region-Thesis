\section{Summary of Results}

Key insights related to mesh resolution, numerical schemes, and turbulence modelling are found during the post-processing stage of the assignment. Using a finer mesh resolution can enhance accuracy for boundary layer flows. However, it can also lead to convergence issues, which may require mesh optimization. When using a first-order upwind scheme, accuracy near discontinuities is sacrificed for computational efficiency. Therefore, adaptive meshing or advanced numerical schemes may be necessary. The SST turbulence model performs better than the k-omega model in complex flows. To ensure accuracy and overcome computational constraints, careful consideration of meshing, numerical methods, and turbulence models is imperative in CFD modelling.
